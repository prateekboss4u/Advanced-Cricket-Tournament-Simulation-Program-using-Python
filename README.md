# Advanced-Cricket-Tournament-Simulation-Program-using-Python
The goal of this assignment is to develop a Python program that simulates a cricket tournament involving various teams with an advanced level of detail. The application should be designed to mimic real-world cricket matches and statistics.


# Program Overview
The program consists of the following key classes:
Player: Represents a player in a cricket team, with attributes such as name, bowling, batting, fielding, running, and experience.
Team: Represents a cricket team, with methods for selecting a captain, sending the next player to the field, choosing a bowler, and managing the batting order.
Field: Represents the field conditions, including size, fan ratio, pitch conditions, and home advantage.
Umpire: Handles the umpiring and scoring of the match, predicting the outcome of a ball based on player stats.
Commentator: Provides commentary for each ball and over, generating descriptions of game events.
Match: Simulates an individual cricket match, using objects of the above classes to start, change innings, and end the match.
